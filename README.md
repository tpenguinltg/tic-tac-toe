# Tic-Tac-Toe
Web-based [tic-tac-toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe). It even works in IE6!

Credits to Randall Munroe's [XKCD comic #832](https://www.xkcd.com/832/) for the data for the Impossible difficulty. Thanks also to [nneonneo](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Nneonneo) for adding logical IDs to the image on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Tictactoe-O.svg), which allowed me to easily extract the data.
